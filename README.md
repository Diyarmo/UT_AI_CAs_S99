# University of Tehran, Artificial Intelligence Course Computer Assignments, Spring 1399(2020)

## CA1
The problem of the assignment is to drive an ambulance through a city to take all the patients to hospitals.

BFS, IDS, and A* search algorithms are implemented to solve the problem. Then computation time and total steps are compared.

## CA2

A text has been cipher using a substitution cipher, the assignment asks to decipher the text or in other words, find the right substitution.

A Genetic Algorithm is implemented to do so. A global corpus of English words is used to determine if a word is valid or not. Then for each chromosome, the ratio of valid decoded words is calculated and the best chromosomes of each generation are selected to be in the mating pool. The rest of the generation would randomly experience mutation.

## CA3
The assignment asks for a classifier to classify documents into Business, Style & Beauty, Travel classes. The documents are normalized by removing stopwords, applying stemming and lemmatization, etc. Then using the bag-of-words method and Bayesian classifier each document is classified.

## CA4
The assignment asks for a classifier that determines whether a customer returns or not. KNN, Decision Tree, and Logistic Classifier are used in the first phase. In the second phase, Voting algorithms are used to achieve higher accuracy.

# CA5

The assignment asks to train a classifier on the Fashion-MNIST dataset using Multi-Layer Neural Networks. The PyTorch framework is used to implement and train the model.

# Extra CA

Logistic Regression and a three-layer neural network are implemented only using the NumPy library.
